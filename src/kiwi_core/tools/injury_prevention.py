Injury prevention and return-to-sport tools for Kiwi.

Evidence-based injury risk assessment, workload monitoring, and prevention protocols:
- Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) calculation (Gabbett 2016)
- Ten Percent Rule for load progression
- Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scoring and composite analysis
- Overuse risk screening (youth and adult athletes)
- Prevention protocol database (8+ evidence-based programs)
- Return-to-sport decision framework
