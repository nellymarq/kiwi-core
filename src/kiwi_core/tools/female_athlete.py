Female athlete health tools for Kiwi.

Evidence-based tools for female-specific performance and health monitoring:
- Energy availability calculation (Loucks thresholds)
- Menstrual cycle phase–training matching
- RED-S risk screening (IOC consensus, Mountjoy 2018)
- Postpartum return-to-sport protocols
- Iron needs calculation for female athletes
