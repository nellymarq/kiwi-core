Environmental performance factors for Kiwi.

Evidence-based tools for environmental training adaptation:
- Altitude training optimizer (hypoxic dose, acclimatization timelines)
- Heat acclimatization (WBGT, core temp thresholds)
- Air quality adjustment (AQI-based training modifications)
- Cold exposure protocols
- Jet lag / travel fatigue management
