    Monkey-patches client_manager's 6 path constants to point inside

    'test_athlete'. Returns the client name.

    Used by memory-module tests (progress, profile, interventions,
    sessions, session_log, watch_list). test_preferences.py overrides
    this with its own local fixture returning 'test_client' because
    test bodies reference that literal.

    Fixture is per-test scoped; each test gets a fresh tmp_path + fresh
    monkey-patches (monkeypatch auto-reverts after each test).
